# Nicotine+ Plugin Core (NPC)

This is the core tp all my [Nicotine+][n+] plugins. It provides a more advanced
way to create plugins than the default n+ way. It is only a layer on top of the
default way, so you can still use the default way to create plugins.

Some features of this core are:

- Documentation
- Full type hints support
- Command decorator
- Non blocking commands
- Periodic tasks support
- Automatic update checking
- Detect changes in settings
- Plugin reload via a command
- And more...
